# Constants Config Guide

This guide provides an overview of the framework's constants overrides configuration system, designed to support a range of setups from simple, single-instance applications to complex, multi-tenant platforms. Understanding how the framework selects/overrides constant file and the flexibility built into this process will help you tailor the framework to your specific needs.

## Constants File Selection Process

The framework intelligently selects the most appropriate config file based on the operational context, ensuring optimal settings for every scenario.

### Multi-Tenant and Single-Tenant Modes

- **Multi-Tenant Mode**: In environments hosting multiple tenants, the framework looks for tenant-specific config files within a dedicated directory structure, typically following the pattern: `/path/to/app/configs/<tenant_id>/config.php`.

- **Single-Tenant Mode**: For single-tenant or simpler setups, the framework defaults to a standard config file located at: `/path/to/app/config.php`.

### Fallback Mechanism

If the specified config file is not found, the framework will attempt to use an alternate default file from a secondary configs directory: `/path/to/app/configs/config.php`. This step ensures the application has a configuration to fall back on, maintaining smooth operation.

## Security Considerations

### Handling Sensitive Information

> [!CAUTION]
It's important to handle sensitive information, such as API keys, secrets and other credentials, with utmost caution.

Sensitive information should **never** be hard-coded directly into your constants configuration files. Instead:

- Store sensitive information within the `.env` file, a secure and environment-specific file that is not committed to version control.
- Reference these sensitive values in your application by utilizing the `env()` function. This approach ensures that sensitive details are securely managed and easily configurable across different environments without altering your application's core configuration files.


## Constants File Flexibility

The framework is designed with built-in defaults that allow the application to run smoothly without the need for a custom config file. This design choice emphasizes ease of use and simplicity for straightforward setups.

### Optional Constants Files

- **Ease of Setup**: For many applications, especially those that don't require customization beyond the default settings, no `config.php` file is needed. The framework will operate with its built-in defaults.

- **Conditional Loading**: Config `config.php` files are loaded only if present. This approach ensures that the absence of a config file does not impact the application's functionality.

## Customizing Your Application

While the default settings are suitable for many scenarios, you might need to override these settings as your application grows or your needs become more specific.

### When to Add Constants `config.php` File

Consider adding a config file if you need to:

- **Override Defaults**: Customize SSL settings established by the framework, or other application-specific parameters.

- **Accommodate Multiple Tenants**: In a multi-tenant setup, provide unique config for each tenant without altering the framework's core functionality.

### Getting Started

- **Initial Setup**: Begin with the default settings to get your application up and running quickly. Add config files as your customization needs evolve.

- **Advanced Configuration**: For more complex setups, including multi-tenant environments, organize your config files in the tenant-specific directory structure to maintain clarity and ease of management.

## Example Use Cases

- **Simple Website**: Running a standard website with no special configuration needs? The framework is ready to go as is, no additional config required.

- **Multi-Tenant Platform**: Operating a multi-tenant platform? Create a unique `config.php` file for each tenant within their respective directories to ensure customized experiences.

> This guide aims to provide you with a clear understanding of the framework's flexible and intelligent const configuration system. By following these guidelines, you can tailor the framework to meet your exact requirements, whether you're managing a simple site or a complex, multi-tenant platform.

## Initial Framework Constants

Before setting up the full environment, the framework defines several key initial constants. These constants form the foundation for determining configuration paths, application root, and the environment type. If these constants are not already defined, default values are assigned.

> [!DANGER]
> **Modifying Initial Constants:** Modifying these initial constants can lead to **unexpected behavior** if not handled carefully. These constants are fundamental to the proper functioning of the framework setup. Ensure that any modifications are thoroughly tested to avoid breaking the initialization process or causing instability in the application.

## **Initial Constants**

- **`SITE_CONFIGS_DIR`**:  
  Specifies the directory where site-specific configuration files are stored. By default, it is set to `'configs'`.

- **`APP_DIR_PATH`**:  
  Defines the root path of the application. This constant points to the main application directory, allowing the framework to locate necessary files.

- **`APP_HTTP_HOST`**:  
  Sets the HTTP host for the application. By default, this is dynamically determined from the current environment.

- **`RAYDIUM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE`**:  
  Identifies the environment type for the application (e.g., development, production). By default, it is set to `null`.

> These initial constants are fundamental for setting up the environment, and their default values ensure that the application has a solid foundation before other constants are set.
